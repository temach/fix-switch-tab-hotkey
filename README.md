# Getting started
So by default the shortcuts are set to Shift + Alt + Left / Right arrow.

To install:
0. download/git clone the repo
1. Go to: chrome://extensions
2. turn on dev mode toggle in upper right corner
3. choose install unpacked and select this directory
4. go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts to customise keys if you want

# Thanks
Large thanks to firefox extension: https://github.com/jscher2000/Hotkeys-to-Switch-Tabs-Left-and-Right/blob/master/background.js

This is basically a chromium port of it (had to upgrade to v3 manifest).

Also small thanks to chromium extension for serving as reference: https://github.com/mohnish/rearrange-tabs


# Not thanks
Chome/Chromium keep up their bullshit: no chrome extension can use Alt + Ctrl combo together in the same shortcut. Super annoying!


# License
Just do whatever you want with this code.
